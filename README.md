> A "tidy" toolkit for forecasting and time series analysis

The `sweep` package combines a set of tools for performing forecasts and time series analysis in the "tidyverse". While the package is geared towards the workflow required to perform forecasts using Rob Hyndman's `forecast` package, it contains elements that can help when performing time series analysis using tibbles ("tidy" data frames).

Benefits
--------

-   **Designed for modeling and scaling forecast analyses using the the `tidyverse` tools in [*R for Data Science*](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/)**
-   **Extends `broom` for forecast model analysis**
-   **Combined with the `forecast` and `tidyquant` packages enables end-to-end time series analysis capability**
-   **Eliminates time series coercion issues between time-based tibbles ("tidy" data frames) and the major time series data types `xts`, `zoo`, `zooreg`, and `ts`**

Tools
-----

The package contains four primary elements:

1.  **coercion functions**: `sw_tbl`, `sw_ts`, `sw_xts`, `sw_zoo`, and `sw_zooreg`. These functions coerce time-based tibbles `tbl` to and from each of the main time-series data types `xts`, `zoo`, `zooreg`, `ts`, maintaining the time-based index.

2.  **broom model tidiers**: `sw_tidy`, `sw_glance`, `sw_augment`, `sw_tidy_decomp`. These functions extend `tidy`, `glance`, and `augment` from the `broom` package specifically for models (`ets()`, `Arima()`, `bats()`, etc) used for forecasting.

3.  **forecast tidier**: `sw_sweep` converts a `forecast` to a tibble that can be easily manipulated in the "tidyverse".

4.  **enhanced mapping functions**: `map_list_column` enables applying functions to lists for quickly creating complex nested data frames.

Making forecasts in the tidyverse
---------------------------------

`sweep` enables transitioning from tibble to ts, from ts to model (e.g. Arima, ets, etc), from model to forecast, and then from forecast to tibble. The result is ability to use `dplyr`, `tidyr`, and `ggplot` natively to manipulate, analyze and visualize forecasts.

Forecasting multiple time series groups at scale
------------------------------------------------

Often forecasts are required on grouped data to analyse trends in sub-categories. The good news is scaling from one time series to many is easy with the various `sw_` functions and the enhanced mapping function `map_list_column`.

Forecasting multiple models for accuracy

broom extensions for forecasting
--------------------------------

If you are familiar with `broom`, you know how useful it is for retrieving "tidy" format model coefficients (`tidy`), accuracy statistics (`glance`), and residuals (`augment`). The `sweep` package extends these functions to forecast modeling functions such as ARIMA, ETS, BATS, TBATS, NNETAR, and more: just use the `sweep` functions, `sw_tidy`, `sw_glance`, and `sw_augment`. In addition, a new tidier, `sw_tidy_decomp` is designed to specifically tidy models that produce seasonal decompositions. The compatibility chart is listed below.
