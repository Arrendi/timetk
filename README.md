> A "tidy" toolkit for forecasting and time series analysis

The `sweep` package combines a collection of tools for performing forecasts and time series analysis in the "tidyverse". While the package is geared towards the workflow required to perform forecasts using Rob Hyndman's `forecast` package, it contains elements that can help when performing time series analysis using tibbles ("tidy" data frames).

Benefits
--------

-   **Designed for modeling and scaling forecast analyses using the the `tidyverse` tools in [*R for Data Science*](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/)**
-   **Extends `broom` for forecast model analysis**
-   **Maximizes data retention and simplifies the coercion process between time-based tibbles (`tbl`) and the major time series data types `xts`, `zoo`, `zooreg`, and `ts`**
-   **Combined with the `forecast` and `tidyquant` packages enables end-to-end time series analysis capability**

Tools
-----

The package contains the following elements:

1.  **forecast tidier**: `sw_sweep` converts a `forecast` object to a tibble that can be easily manipulated in the "tidyverse".

2.  **broom model tidiers**: `sw_tidy`, `sw_glance`, `sw_augment`, `sw_tidy_decomp` functions extend `tidy`, `glance`, and `augment` from the `broom` package specifically for models (`ets()`, `Arima()`, `bats()`, etc) used for forecasting.

3.  **coercion functions**: `sw_tbl`, `sw_ts`, `sw_xts`, `sw_zoo`, and `sw_zooreg` coerce time-based tibbles `tbl` to and from each of the main time-series data types `xts`, `zoo`, `zooreg`, `ts`, maintaining the time-based index.

4.  **unroll function**: `sw_unroll_index` returns the original time series index of `forecast`objects, models, and `ts` objects. Only applicable to `ts` objects coerced using the `sw_ts()` function on data objects with a time-based index (e.g. `tbl`, `xts`, `zoo`).

Making forecasts in the tidyverse
---------------------------------

`sweep` enables transitioning from tibble to ts, from ts to model (e.g. Arima, ets, etc), from model to forecast, and then from forecast to tibble. The result is ability to use `dplyr`, `tidyr`, and `ggplot` natively to manipulate, analyze and visualize forecasts.

Forecasting multiple time series groups at scale
------------------------------------------------

Often forecasts are required on grouped data to analyse trends in sub-categories. The good news is scaling from one time series to many is easy with the various `sw_` functions and the enhanced mapping function `map_list_column`.

Forecasting multiple models for accuracy

broom extensions for forecasting
--------------------------------

If you are familiar with `broom`, you know how useful it is for retrieving "tidy" format model coefficients (`tidy`), accuracy statistics (`glance`), and residuals (`augment`). The `sweep` package extends these functions to forecast modeling functions such as ARIMA, ETS, BATS, TBATS, NNETAR, and more: just use the `sweep` functions, `sw_tidy`, `sw_glance`, and `sw_augment`. In addition, a new tidier, `sw_tidy_decomp` is designed to specifically tidy models that produce seasonal decompositions. The compatibility chart is listed below.

Extensible time series coercion
-------------------------------

The coercion functions `sw_tbl`, `sw_xts`, `sw_zoo`, `sw_zooreg`, and `sw_ts` enable maximize data retention and simplify the coercion process. Further working with regularized time series (`ts`) class has been a particular pain until now.

``` r
# Time based tibble
data_tbl <- tibble(
    date = seq.Date(from = as.Date("2010-01-01"), by = 1, length.out = 5),
    x    = seq(100, 120, by = 5)
)
data_tbl
#> # A tibble: 5 × 2
#>         date     x
#>       <date> <dbl>
#> 1 2010-01-01   100
#> 2 2010-01-02   105
#> 3 2010-01-03   110
#> 4 2010-01-04   115
#> 5 2010-01-05   120

# Coercion from time-based tibble to ts using sw_ts()
data_ts <- sw_ts(data_tbl, start = c(2010,1), freq = 365)

# Comparison between as.data.frame() and sw_tbl()

# No index
as.data.frame(data_ts)
#>     x
#> 1 100
#> 2 105
#> 3 110
#> 4 115
#> 5 120

# Regularized numeric index starting in 2010
sw_tbl(data_ts)
#> # A tibble: 5 × 2
#>      index     x
#>      <dbl> <dbl>
#> 1 2010.000   100
#> 2 2010.003   105
#> 3 2010.005   110
#> 4 2010.008   115
#> 5 2010.011   120

# Original date index unrolled 
sw_tbl(data_ts, .unroll = TRUE)
#> # A tibble: 5 × 2
#>        index     x
#>       <date> <dbl>
#> 1 2010-01-01   100
#> 2 2010-01-02   105
#> 3 2010-01-03   110
#> 4 2010-01-04   115
#> 5 2010-01-05   120
