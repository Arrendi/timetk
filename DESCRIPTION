Description: The 'sweep' package is a swiss army knife for "tidy" time series forecasting.
    The goal of the 'sweep' package is to "tidy" up the 
    forecasting workflow. In doing so, the 'sweep' package provides three
    main benefits. First, it provides functions to easily coerce between 
    tibbles ("tidy" data frames) and the various time series data structures. 
    Second, it extends the 'broom' package by providing 'tidy', 'glance', and 
    'augment' functions for various forecasting models. 
    Third, it provides the 'sweep' function which coerces
    'forecast' objects to tibbles.
