Creating and modifying date sequences is critical to machine learning projects. We discuss:

- Making a Time Series Sequence
- Making a Future Sequence


# Prerequisites

Before we get started, load the following packages.

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(timetk)
```

# Making a Time Series Sequence

> Intelligent date and date-time sequence creation.

`tk_make_timeseries()` improves on the `seq.Date()` and `seq.POSIXt()` functions by simplifying into 1 function. Intelligently handles character dates and logical assumptions based on user inputs.

__By Day__

- Can use `by = "day"` or leave blank. 
- `include_endpoints = FALSE` removes the last value so your series is only 7 observations. 

```{r}
# Selects by day automatically
tk_make_timeseries("2011-01-01", length_out = "7 days", include_endpoints = FALSE)
```

__By 2 Seconds__

- Can use `by = "2 sec"` to adjust the interval width.
- `include_endpoints = TRUE` keeps the last value the series ends on the 6th second. 

```{r}
# Guesses by second
tk_make_timeseries("2016-01-01", by = "2 sec", length_out = "6 seconds")
```

__Length Out = 1 year 6 months__

- `length_out = "1 year 6 months"` - Can include complex expressions like "1 year 4 months 6 days".

```{r}
tk_make_timeseries("2012-01-01", by = "1 month",
                   length_out = "1 year 6 months", 
                   include_endpoints = FALSE)
```

__In Reverse__

- To go in reverse, just use `end_date` as where you want the series to end. 

```{r}
tk_make_timeseries(end_date = "2012-01-01", 
                   by = "1 month",
                   length_out = "1 year 6 months", 
                   include_endpoints = FALSE)
```

# Future Time Series Sequence

A common operation is to make a future time series sequence that mimics an existing. This is what `tk_make_future_timeseries()` is for. 

```{r}
idx <- tk_make_timeseries("2012-01-01", by = "3 months", 
                          length_out = "2 years", include_endpoints = FALSE)
idx
```

```{r}
tk_make_future_timeseries(idx, n_future = 4)
```


# Weekends & Holidays

__Make weekday sequence removing holidays__

```{r}
idx <- tk_make_weekday_sequence("2012-01-01", "2012-12-31", 
                                remove_weekends = TRUE, 
                                remove_holidays = TRUE)

tk_get_timeseries_summary(idx)
```

__Which holidays were removed?__

```{r}
tk_make_holiday_sequence("2012-01-01", "2012-12-31", calendar = "NYSE")
```


__Make future index removing holidays__

```{r}
holidays <- tk_make_holiday_sequence(
    start_date = "2013-01-01",
    end_date   = "2013-12-31",
    calendar   = "NYSE")

idx_future <- idx %>%
   tk_make_future_timeseries(n_future         = 366,
                             inspect_weekdays = TRUE,
                             skip_values      = holidays)

tk_get_timeseries_summary(idx)
```
